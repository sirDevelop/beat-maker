# beat-maker
An application allowing the user to generate their own beats and music writting in HTML/CSS/Javascript

For each type of sound kick, snare, and hihat, be sure to click up one of the 8 pads to the right to generate sound.
Only when the pad is highlighted, will it produce sound.
Feel free to select the type of rhythm and the tempo.
